        <p>The Node.js core itself has its foundations built on a few principles; one of
these is, having the smallest set of functionality, leaving the rest to the so-called
<span>userland</span> (or userspace), the ecosystem of modules living outside the core. This
principle has an enormous impact on the <span>Node.js</span> culture, as it gives freedom to the
community to experiment and iterate fast on a broader set of solutions within the
scope of the userland modules, instead of being imposed with one slowly evolving
solution that is built into the more tightly controlled and stable core. Keeping the
core <span>set of functionality</span> to the bare minimum then, not only becomes convenient
in terms of maintainability, but also in terms of the positive cultural impact that it
brings on the evolution of the entire ecosystem.</p>
